                <h1>Roberta's Pizza with Guanciale and Egg</h1>
                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One 28-oz can San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                            <li>Good olive oil</li>
                            <li>Fine sea salt</li>
                            <li>1 round of pizza dough</li>
                            <li>80 grams fresh mozzarella</li>
                            <li>20 grams guanciale, very thinkly sliced. Substitute pancetta or bacon if needed.</li>
                            <li>1 large egg</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To make the pizza sauce, drain the tomatoes and discard the juice. Ise a blender to puree the tomatoes until almost smooth. Add a splash of olive oil and a pinch of salt, blend until smooth and taste. Add more oil and salt to taste, but remember that the sauce will reduce a little when it's baked on a pizza, so be judicious with the salt. The sauce will keep in the fridge for a week or the freezer for 6 months. (Which is good because they only call for 3 Tbs. for a pizza.).</li>
                            <li>Put 3 Tbs. of sauce in the center of the dough round and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly over the pizza, stopping about half an inch from the edge. Break the mozzarella into pieces and distribute them over the pizza, leaving a space in the middle where the egg will go. Distribute guanciale over the pizza in the same way. Give the pizza a small drizzle of olive oil and bake it in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
                            <li>While the pizza is cooking, coat a saute pan lightly with olive oil and set it over medium heat. Crack the egg into the pan and cook it without moving it until the white just barely sets. The white should be set, but the yolk should still be runny. When the pizza is done, slide it out of the oven and put the egg on top.</li>
                        </ol>
