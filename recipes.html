                <h1>Roberta's Pizza with Guanciale and Egg</h1>
                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One 28-oz can San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                            <li>Good olive oil</li>
                            <li>Fine sea salt</li>
                            <li>1 round of pizza dough</li>
                            <li>80 grams fresh mozzarella</li>
                            <li>20 grams guanciale, very thinkly sliced. Substitute pancetta or bacon if needed.</li>
                            <li>1 large egg</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To make the pizza sauce, drain the tomatoes and discard the juice. Ise a blender to puree the tomatoes until almost smooth. Add a splash of olive oil and a pinch of salt, blend until smooth and taste. Add more oil and salt to taste, but remember that the sauce will reduce a little when it's baked on a pizza, so be judicious with the salt. The sauce will keep in the fridge for a week or the freezer for 6 months. (Which is good because they only call for 3 Tbs. for a pizza.).</li>
                            <li>Put 3 Tbs. of sauce in the center of the dough round and use the back of a spoon to spread it evenly over the pizza, stopping about half an inch from the edge. Break the mozzarella into pieces and distribute them over the pizza, leaving a space in the middle where the egg will go. Distribute guanciale over the pizza in the same way. Give the pizza a small drizzle of olive oil and bake it in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
                            <li>While the pizza is cooking, coat a saute pan lightly with olive oil and set it over medium heat. Crack the egg into the pan and cook it without moving it until the white just barely sets. The white should be set, but the yolk should still be runny. When the pizza is done, slide it out of the oven and put the egg on top.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ul>
                            <li>1 butternut squash</li>

                            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
                            <li>10 cloves, garlic whole and unpeeled</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup fresh ricotta</li>
                            <li>1 cup grated fontina</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons grated parmesan</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>    
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                            <li>Cut the squash into two pieces to separate the rounder part from the narrower section. Peel the entire squash, cut both parts in half and remove any seeds. Cut all four pieces into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Put in a large bowl and add the olive oil, chopped garlic and thyme. Toss to coat evenly. Spread out on one of the prepared baking sheets. Set the bowl aside. Sprinkle the squash with the salt and pepper. Put the garlic on the baking sheet and bake until the squash and garlic are tender, about 25-30 minutes. Let cool.</li>
                            <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll out the dough into a large circle about 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to parchment paper–lined baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
                            <li>When the garlic is cool enough to handle, peel and put in the reserved bowl. Mash with the back of a wooden spoon until smooth. Stir in the ricotta.</li>
                            <li>Remove the pastry from the fridge and spread the garlic-cheese mixture over the top, leaving a 1-inch border. Spread the squash over the garlic-cheese mixture and fold the edges toward the center of the galette. Sprinkle the fontina over the center of the galette. Sprinkle the edges of the crust with the parmesan and bake until the crust is crisp and golden brown, about 25-30 minutes. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.

                <h1>Classic Margherita Pie with No-Knead Dough</h1>
                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 28-ounce can best quality peeled Italian tomatoes (or fresh, peeled Roma tomatoes)</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
                            <li>2 pounds fresh mozzarella cheese, toen into large chunks</li>
                            <li>20 fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
                            <li>3/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Put the pizza stone on a rack in a gas oven about 8 inches from the broiler. Preheat the oven on bake at 500 degrees for 30 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Shaping the disk (Method 1): Take one ball of dough and generously flour it, your hands, and the work surface. Gently press down and stretch the ball of dough out to 10-12 inches. Don't worry if it's not round. Don't handle it more than necessary; you want some of the gas bubbles to remain in the dough. It should look slightly blistered. Flour the peel (or an unrimmed baking sheet) and lay the disk onto the center. It is now ready to be topped.</li>
                            <li>Shaping the disk (Method 2): Take one ball of dough and generously flour it, your hands, and the work surface. Gently press down and stretch the ball of dough out to 6-8 inches. Supporting the disk with your knuckles toward the outer edge and lifting it above the work surface, keep stretching the dough by rotating it with your knuckles, gently pulling it wider until the disk reaches 10-12 inches. Set the disk on a well-floured peel (or unrimmed baking sheet). It is now ready to be topped.</li>
                            <li>Drain tomatoes and pass through a food mill or just squish them with your hands -- it's messy but fun. Stir in the olive oil and salt. The sauce will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
                            <li>Switch the oven to broil for 10 minutes. With the dough on the peel, spoon the tomato sauce over the surface and spread it evenly, leaving about an inch of the rim untouched. Distribute 10 to 12 hunks of mozzarella (about 7 ounces) on top.</li>
                            <li>With quick, jerking motions, slide the pie onto the stone. Broil for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes under gas (somewhat longer with an electric oven), until the top is bubbling and the crust is nicely charred but not burnt.</li>
                            <li>Using the peel, transfer the pizza to a tray or serving platter. Sprinkle the Parmigiano and salt evenly over the pizza. Distribute the basil on top. Slice and serve immediately.
