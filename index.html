                <h1>Pizza History</h1>
                    <p>According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> the modern pizza was invented in Naples, Italy, and since then has become popular in many parts of the world.  
                    <br>
                    The word pizza originates from the Latin verb <em>pinsere</em>, meaning "to press," and from the Greek <em>pitta</em>, meaning "solid" or "clotted." The ancient Greeks covered their bread with oils, herbs and cheese. The Romans developed placenta, a sheet of dough topped with cheese and hiney and flavored with bay leaves. 
                    <br>
                    Pizza migrated to America with the Italians. After World War II many returning soldiers who were stationed in Italy created a high demand for the pizza they encountered and tasted in Italy.
